      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kyle. Before starting a software development learning path at Code Fellows Academy, I was in project management and sales enablement support for a fortune 500 company. Now, I'm a software developer currently working with newest front-end frameworks like React. I love to be surrounded with like minded critical thinkers and problem solvers to approach new challenges with tenacity and resilience, with a chance to create something that helps everyday people. My prior experience working with the direct public, high profile clientele, and cross functional orgs help to give me a deeper understanding of problem domains on a broader scope. Thanks for dropping by!",
